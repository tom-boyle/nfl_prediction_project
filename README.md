# NFL Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the win/loss outcome of each NFL game for the 2022 season using various data points from the 'Games by Season' dataset provided by SportsDataIO.

## Data Source
The data used for this project comes from the 'Games by Season' dataset provided by [SportsDataIO](https://sportsdata.io/). Specifically, we're leveraging the data for the 2022 NFL season. This dataset offers comprehensive game results, including scores, locations, teams, and more.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory containing all datasets used for the project.
- `scripts/`: Directory containing scripts, including the data fetching script.
- `models/`: Directory for storing trained machine learning models (to be used in later stages of the project).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model experimentation.

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/tom-boyle/nfl_prediction_project
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd nfl_prediction_project
3. Run the data collection script (ensure you have an API key from SportsDataIO): python scripts/fetch_data.py
Further steps will be added as the project progresses.

## Results
